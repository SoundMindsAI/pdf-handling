# Structured Markdown Output

This directory contains the final structured markdown files generated from the PDF document.

## Files in this Directory

- `{pdf_name}_structured.md` - Basic structured markdown generated by `pdf_to_basic_markdown.py`
- `{pdf_name}_improved.md` - Enhanced structured markdown with better section recognition and field extraction generated by `pdf_to_enhanced_markdown.py`

## Dynamic File Naming

Files are named based on the original PDF filename:
- For a PDF named "example.pdf", the output files will be:
  - `example_structured.md` - Basic structured markdown
  - `example_improved.md` - Enhanced structured markdown

## Generation Process

### Basic Structured Markdown

The basic structured markdown file is generated by running:

```bash
python pdf_to_basic_markdown.py --pdf_path=./your_pdf_file.pdf
```

This script identifies known sections in the PDF, attempts to detect subsections, and formats the content into a readable markdown structure.

### Enhanced Structured Markdown

The enhanced structured markdown file is generated by running:

```bash
python pdf_to_enhanced_markdown.py --pdf_path=./your_pdf_file.pdf
```

This script performs deeper analysis of the PDF structure, extracting more semantic meaning where possible, and produces a more refined markdown output.
