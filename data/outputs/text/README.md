# Text Extraction Output

This directory contains the raw text extracted from each page of the PDF using the PyPDF library via the `pdf_text_extractor.py` script.

## Files in this Directory

- `{pdf_name}_page_1.txt`, `{pdf_name}_page_2.txt`, etc. - Text content extracted from each page of the PDF

## Generation Process

These files are generated by running:

```bash
python pdf_text_extractor.py --pdf_path=./your_pdf_file.pdf
```

Where `{pdf_name}` is the name of your PDF file without the extension.

## Usage Notes

- The text extraction process attempts to preserve the original content, but may lose some formatting.
- Some special characters or complex layouts in the PDF might not be perfectly preserved.
- Each file contains the raw text content before any structural processing is applied.
