## Output Types

### 1. Tables

The `tables/` directory contains tables extracted from the PDF using the Camelot-py library via the `pdf_table_extractor.py` script. Both raw extracted tables and cleaned versions are provided.

### 2. Text

The `text/` directory contains the raw text extracted from each page of the PDF using the PyPDF library via the `pdf_text_extractor.py` script.

### 3. Markdown

The `markdown/` directory contains structured markdown files generated from the PDF content. The filename is based on the original PDF name with specific suffixes:
- `{pdf_name}_structured.md`: Basic structured version with sections and subsections.
- `{pdf_name}_improved.md`: Enhanced version with better field extraction and formatting.

For more details, see the README.md file in each subdirectory.
