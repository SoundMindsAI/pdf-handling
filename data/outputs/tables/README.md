# Table Extraction Output

This directory contains tables extracted from the PDF using the Camelot-py library via the `pdf_table_extractor. py` script.

## Files in this Directory

- `{pdf_name}_table_lattice_*.md` - Tables extracted using Camelot's lattice flavor (looking for line borders)
- `{pdf_name}_table_stream_*.md` - Tables extracted using Camelot's stream flavor (looking for whitespace)

## Clean Tables

The `clean/` subdirectory contains cleaned versions of the extracted tables:

- `{pdf_name}_clean_lattice_*.md` - Cleaned lattice tables with parsing artifacts removed
- `{pdf_name}_clean_stream_*.md` - Cleaned stream tables with parsing artifacts removed
- `clean_{pdf_name}_table_lattice_*.md` - Alternative format for cleaned lattice tables
- `clean_{pdf_name}_table_stream_*.md` - Alternative format for cleaned stream tables

## Generation Process

These files are generated by running:

```bash
python pdf_table_extractor. py --pdf_path=./your_pdf_file. pdf
```

Where `{pdf_name}` is the name of your PDF file without the extension.
